        <li>If you have to go outside or if dust starts entering your shelter, use a dust mask, scarf, or cloth to cover your nose and mouth to avoid inhaling fine particles.</li>
        <li>Wait until the storm subsides and visibility improves before venturing outside.</li>
        <li>Dust storms can be frightening due to low visibility and the potential for damage. Stay calm and reassure others.</li>
        <li>Keep a battery-powered radio or a charged smartphone to listen for updates and instructions from local authorities.</li>
        <li>Before the storm hits, secure any outdoor items that could become projectiles in the strong winds.</li>
        <li>Once the dust storm has passed and visibility has improved, be cautious when going outside.</li>
        <li>If you experience any respiratory issues due to dust exposure, seek medical attention.</li>
        <p>Dust storms can be dangerous due to limited visibility and the potential health risks associated with inhaling fine dust particles. Taking immediate action to seek shelter and protect yourself is crucial. Always follow instructions from local authorities and stay informed about weather conditions in your area.</p>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="hidden">Being trapped in a heatwave can be dangerous, especially for vulnerable individuals. Here are some steps to follow if you find yourself in the midst of a heatwave:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Drink plenty of water throughout the day, even if you don't feel thirsty. Avoid alcohol and caffeine, as they can lead to dehydration.</li>
        <li>Seek air-conditioned places like malls, libraries, or community centers during the hottest parts of the day.</li>
        <li>If you don't have access to air conditioning, use fans or take cool showers to lower your body temperature.</li>
        <li>Try to avoid strenuous activities, especially during the peak heat hours (usually between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.).</li>
        <li>If you need to be outside, take frequent breaks in the shade and wear lightweight, loose-fitting clothing, a wide-brimmed hat, and sunscreen.</li>
        <li>Regularly check on elderly family members, neighbors, and anyone with medical conditions who may be more susceptible to heat-related illnesses.</li>
        <li>Monitor weather forecasts and heat advisories from local authorities. They may provide guidance and open cooling centers during extreme heat events.</li>
        <li>Keep curtains and blinds closed during the hottest parts of the day to block out direct sunlight and reduce indoor temperatures.</li>
        <li>Again, emphasize the importance of staying hydrated. Dehydration can sneak up quickly during a heatwave.</li>
        <li>Never leave children or pets in a parked car during a heatwave, as temperatures inside a car can quickly become lethal.</li>
        <li>Choose clothing made of natural, breathable fabrics like cotton to help your body stay cool.</li>
        <li>Be aware of the symptoms of heat exhaustion (heavy sweating, weakness, cold, pale, or clammy skin, nausea, and a fast, weak pulse) and heatstroke (high body temperature, confusion, loss of consciousness). Seek medical attention if you or someone else exhibits these symptoms.</li>
        <p>During a heatwave, your primary focus should be on staying cool, hydrated, and informed. Heatwaves can be life-threatening, especially for vulnerable populations, so taking these precautions is crucial for your safety.</p>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="hidden">Living in a drought-prone area can be challenging, but there are steps you can take to cope with and adapt to the conditions. Here's what you can do if you're in a drought-prone place:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Use water-saving appliances and fixtures and fix leaks promptly.</li>
        <li>Water your lawn and garden during cooler times of the day to minimize evaporation.</li>
        <li>Collect rainwater for non-potable uses like watering plants.</li>
        <li>Take shorter showers and turn off the tap when brushing your teeth or washing dishes.</li>
        <li>Only run your dishwasher and washing machine with full loads.</li>
        <li>Consider replacing lawns with drought-resistant landscaping.</li>
        <li>Be aware of any water use restrictions or guidelines set by local authorities, and adhere to them.</li>
        <li>Check for and repair any indoor water and use a broom instead of a hose to clean driveways and sidewalks.</li>
        <li>Learn about the local water supply and drought conditions. Stay informed about any drought-related updates or restrictions.</li>
        <li>Consider using water-efficient appliances and fixtures in your home. Also be conscious of your water usage in daily activities, such as cooking and cleaning.</li>
        <li>If you're involved in agriculture or gardening, implement water-efficient irrigation methods and drought-resistant crops or plants.</li>
        <li>Advocate for and support investment in infrastructure that helps manage and store water more efficiently, such as reservoirs, rainwater harvesting systems, and wastewater recycling.</li>
        <li>Have a water storage plan in place, including storing an emergency supply of water in case of extended drought conditions.</li>
        <li>Participate in community efforts to address drought, such as water conservation campaigns and neighborhood initiatives.</li>
        <li>Develop a family emergency plan that includes provisions for water scarcity, including knowing where to obtain safe drinking water if your regular supply is compromised. Always keep up with local news and government updates regarding drought conditions and water restrictions.</li>
        <p>Droughts can have significant impacts on water resources, agriculture, and daily life, so it's essential to be proactive in conserving water and adapting to these conditions. Collaborating with your community and following local guidelines is crucial in managing and mitigating the effects of drought.</p>
